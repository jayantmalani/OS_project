To run, just use the run.sh scrupt included in the directory.
Usage:
	./run.sh <destination IP> <destination MAC> <port> <interface>
Example:
	./run.sh 137.110.9.216 00:21:56:4a:38:00 80 wlan0

Note that if you want to try handshaking with a server on the internet (i.e.,
outside the local network) you'll use the destination IP address but your
gateway's MAC address.
	./run.sh <Internet server> <Router MAC> <port> <interface>

Best used with Wireshark or TCPDump to be able to verify that the handshake
is happening. The sequnce should be:
<local>:  SYN
<remote>: SYN-ACK
<local>:  ACK
<local>:  RST
